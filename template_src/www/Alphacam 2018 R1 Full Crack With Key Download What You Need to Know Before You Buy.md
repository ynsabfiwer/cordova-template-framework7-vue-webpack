## What is Alphacam 2018 R1?
 
Alphacam 2018 R1 is a CAD/CAM software that is designed for the woodworking, metal, and stone cutting industries. It allows you to create and edit 2D and 3D designs for CNC machining, such as milling, routing, turning, profiling, and wire EDM. Alphacam 2018 R1 supports a wide range of CNC machines and controllers, and can handle complex geometries and operations.
 
## What are the new features of Alphacam 2018 R1?
 
Alphacam 2018 R1 introduces several new features and improvements that enhance the functionality and performance of the software. Some of the main features are:

- Sub-components: You can now add job files to another job file as a sub-component, which allows you to manage parts that should be manufactured in groups. You can also edit the sub-components individually or collectively, and control their visibility and nesting options.
- Enhanced nesting: You can now nest parts with different materials and thicknesses in the same nest project. You can also specify the grain direction for each part, and use the new common line option to reduce material waste and machining time.
- Improved simulation: You can now simulate the machining process with more accuracy and realism. You can see the toolpath animation, the material removal, the clamps and fixtures, and the collisions and gouges. You can also export the simulation as a video file or a 3D PDF file.
- And more: Alphacam 2018 R1 also includes other enhancements, such as improved geometry creation and editing tools, new post processors, updated user interface, and bug fixes.

## How to use Alphacam 2018 R1?
 
To use Alphacam 2018 R1, you will need to follow these basic steps:

1. Create or import a design: You can create a new design from scratch using the geometry tools in Alphacam, or you can import an existing design from another CAD software in various formats, such as DWG, DXF, IGES, STEP, STL, etc.
2. Apply machining operations: You can apply various machining operations to your design, such as drilling, pocketing, contouring, engraving, etc. You can also define the tool parameters, such as diameter, speed, feed rate, etc., and the machining strategies, such as climb or conventional cutting, roughing or finishing passes, etc.
3. Generate toolpaths: You can generate the toolpaths for your machining operations using the automatic or manual options in Alphacam. You can also edit and optimize the toolpaths using the editing tools, such as trim, extend, reverse direction, etc.
4. Simulate and verify: You can simulate and verify your toolpaths before sending them to the CNC machine. You can check for any errors or collisions that may occur during the machining process, and make any necessary adjustments.
5. Output NC code: You can output the NC code for your toolpaths using the post processor that matches your CNC machine and controller. You can also preview and edit the NC code before saving it as a file or sending it directly to the CNC machine.
