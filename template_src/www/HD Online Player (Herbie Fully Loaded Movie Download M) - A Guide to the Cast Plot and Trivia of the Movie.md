If you are looking for a powerful and easy-to-use drum software, you might be interested in EZdrummer 2. This program lets you create realistic drum tracks with various features and sounds. You can buy EZdrummer 2 for Â£99$149, which is a reasonable price for such a versatile tool. However, if you already own the previous version of EZdrummer, you can upgrade to EZdrummer 2 for a lower price of Â£57$89.

So what makes EZdrummer 2 different from other drum software? Well, for starters, it has a very intuitive and user-friendly interface that lets you customize your drum kit, adjust the levels and effects, and browse through thousands of MIDI grooves. You can also use the Tap2Find feature to tap a rhythm on your keyboard or pad and EZdrummer 2 will find the closest matching groove for you.

Another cool feature of EZdrummer 2 is the Song Creator. This function allows you to drag and drop a groove into the Song Creator window and EZdrummer 2 will generate a complete song structure based on that groove. You can then rearrange, delete, or add sections as you like. You can also use the Song Track to record your own drum parts or import MIDI files from other sources. EZdrummer 2 will automatically adjust the tempo and feel of the imported MIDI to match your song.
  
EZdrummer 2 also comes with a huge library of sounds that cover various genres and styles. You can choose from five different drum kits, each with its own unique character and tone. You can also mix and match different drums and cymbals from different kits to create your own custom kit. In addition, you can access a wide range of expansion packs that offer more sounds and grooves for specific genres such as metal, jazz, funk, country, and more.
