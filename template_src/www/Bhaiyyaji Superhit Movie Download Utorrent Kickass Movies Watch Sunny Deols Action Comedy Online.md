The film was released on 23 November 2018 after several delays and received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences. The film was criticized for its outdated humor, weak plot, poor direction, over-the-top action and lack of originality. The film was also compared unfavorably to Salman Khan's Dabangg series, which also features a similar premise of a quirky cop with a troubled love life.
 
The film was a box office flop, earning only Rs. 6.25 crore in its first week against a budget of Rs. 45 crore. The film was also leaked online by torrent sites such as Utorrent and Kickass Movies, which further affected its collections. The film is currently available for streaming on Zee5.

The film's music was composed by Jeet Gannguli, Sanjeev-Darshan, Amjad-Nadeem, Raghav Sachar and Chandan Saxena, while the lyrics were written by Kumaar, Shabbir Ahmed and Neerraj Pathak. The film's soundtrack consists of six songs, featuring singers such as Mika Singh, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Aakanksha Sharma, Yasser Desai and others. The songs were mostly panned by critics for being generic and forgettable.
 
The film's trailer was released on 25 October 2018 and received a mixed response from viewers. Some praised the film's star cast and action sequences, while others criticized the film's outdated humor and cliched plot. The film's official poster was also mocked by netizens for being a rip-off of the Hollywood film The Avengers.
 
The film's director Neerraj Pathak had previously worked with Sunny Deol in the 2010 film Right Yaaa Wrong, which was also a box office failure. Pathak had also written the screenplay for Deol's 2001 film Indian, which was a hit. Pathak had announced Bhaiyyaji Superhit in 2011 and had initially cast Tusshar Kapoor, Ameesha Patel and Zayed Khan in the lead roles. However, due to various reasons, the film's cast and crew underwent several changes over the years. The film's shooting was also delayed due to Deol's injury and other issues.

In an interview, Sunny Deol had said that he had agreed to do the film because he liked the script and the character of Bhaiyyaji. He had also said that he had enjoyed working with Preity Zinta after a long gap. Zinta had also expressed her excitement about working with Deol and playing a different role from her usual ones. She had said that she had played a UP-based woman who speaks in a dialect and wears colorful clothes. She had also said that she had done some action scenes in the film.
 
Some of the positive aspects of the film were the performances of the lead actors, especially Deol and Zinta, who had shown good chemistry and comic timing. The film also had some funny moments and dialogues, especially from Arshad Warsi and Shreyas Talpade, who played the roles of a filmmaker and a writer respectively. The film also had some decent action scenes, choreographed by Abbas Ali Moghul.
