The font family consists of several weights and widths, with 62 glyphs and a fixed pitch of 15.4. The font is monospaced, meaning that each character occupies the same amount of horizontal space. The font has a modern and elegant look, with rounded corners and smooth curves. The font is also optimized for digital display and print media.
 
The Fly Emirates font is not available for sale or public use, as it is a corporate font owned by the Emirates Group. However, there are some ways to download and use the font legally and ethically, such as:
 
- Requesting permission from the Emirates Group to use the font for a specific purpose, such as a school project, a personal design, or a non-commercial work. You can contact the Emirates Group through their website or email address.

- Extracting the font from corporate PDFs that contain the font embedded without any security. You can use tools such as Adobe Acrobat or FontForge to extract the font files from the PDFs. However, this method may not give you access to all the weights and widths of the font family, and may violate the intellectual property rights of the Emirates Group.
