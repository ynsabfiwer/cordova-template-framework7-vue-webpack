If you are looking for a way to flash the official stock ROM on your Lava R5 smartphone, you have come to the right place. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the Lava R5 flash file and use it to fix various issues such as frp lock, dead boot, customer care mode, and more.
  
The Lava R5 is a mid-range Android device that comes with a 6.22-inch HD+ display, a MediaTek Helio P22 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a 13MP rear camera, an 8MP front camera, a 3260mAh battery, and Android 8.1 Oreo as the operating system.

However, like any other smartphone, the Lava R5 can also encounter some problems that may require flashing the firmware. For example, you may forget your Google account password and get stuck in the frp lock screen. Or you may experience a bootloop or a dead boot issue that prevents your phone from turning on. Or you may accidentally enter the customer care mode that shows a red screen with some Chinese characters.
  
In any of these cases, flashing the Lava R5 firmware can help you restore your phone to its original state and fix the issues. But before you proceed, you need to be aware of some important things:
  
- Flashing the firmware will erase all your data and settings on your phone. So make sure you backup your important files before you start.
- Flashing the firmware will void your warranty. So proceed at your own risk.
- Flashing the firmware requires a computer, a USB cable, and some tools such as SP Flash Tool and MTK USB Driver. You can download them from the links provided below.
- Flashing the firmware requires a compatible flash file for your Lava R5 model. You can download it from the link provided below.

Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to flash the Lava R5 firmware:

1. Extract the downloaded flash file on your computer. You should see a folder with some files inside.
2. Install the MTK USB Driver on your computer. This will help your computer recognize your phone when connected.
3. Run the SP Flash Tool as administrator. This is the tool that will flash the firmware on your phone.
4. Click on the "Choose" button next to the "Scatter-loading File" option and browse to the folder where you extracted the flash file. Select the file named "MT6762\_Android\_scatter.txt" and click "Open".
5. Click on the "Download" button at the top of the SP Flash Tool. This will prepare the tool for flashing.
6. Turn off your phone and remove the battery if possible. Then connect it to your computer via USB cable while holding the volume down button. This will put your phone in download mode.
7. The SP Flash Tool will detect your phone and start flashing the firmware. You will see a progress bar and some messages on the screen.
8. Wait until the flashing process is completed. You will see a green tick mark and a "Download OK" message when it is done.
9. Disconnect your phone from your computer and insert the battery if removed. Then turn on your phone normally.
10. Congratulations! You have successfully flashed the Lava R5 firmware and fixed frp lock, dead boot, customer care mode, and other issues.
