In this article, we will reveal some tips and tricks that will help you unlock all the hidden content and features of Game of Thrones Ascent. Whether you want to explore beyond the Wall, join a powerful alliance, or collect rare items, we have you covered. Read on to find out how to become the ultimate player of Game of Thrones Ascent.
 
## Unlocking New Locations
 
One of the main attractions of Game of Thrones Ascent was the ability to visit different locations from the show and the books. The game had nine major regions that players could explore: The North, The Riverlands, The Vale, The Westerlands, The Crownlands, The Stormlands, The Reach, Dorne, and Beyond the Wall. Each region had its own quests, characters, and challenges that players could encounter.
 
To unlock new locations, players had to swear fealty to one of the eight Great Houses: Stark, Lannister, Greyjoy, Baratheon, Targaryen, Tyrell, Tully, or Martell. Each house had its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as its own storyline and allies. Depending on which house players chose, they could access different regions and quests more easily. For example, swearing fealty to House Stark would give players access to The North and Beyond the Wall faster than other houses.
 
However, players were not limited to their chosen house's region. They could also travel to other locations by completing certain quests or by joining an alliance. Alliances were groups of players that cooperated and competed with each other in wars and events. By joining an alliance, players could gain access to regions that their alliance controlled or had influence over. For example, if an alliance controlled The Riverlands, its members could travel there without any restrictions.
 
## Unlocking New Quests
 
Another way to unlock new content in Game of Thrones Ascent was by completing quests. Quests were tasks that players could perform to advance their story, gain resources, or earn rewards. Quests were divided into two types: Volume Quests and Tale Quests.
 
Volume Quests were the main storyline quests that followed the events of the show and the books. They were updated weekly with new episodes and chapters that matched the airing of the show. Volume Quests had multiple paths and endings depending on the choices that players made during the game. For example, players could choose to support or betray certain characters or factions, which would affect their alignment and reputation.
