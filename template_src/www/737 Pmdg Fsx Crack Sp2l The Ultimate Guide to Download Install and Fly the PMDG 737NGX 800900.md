If you want to improve your skills and knowledge of flying the PMDG 737 NGX, here are some tips and tricks that you can use:

- Learn how to use the FMC (Flight Management Computer) to program your route, performance, and navigation. The FMC is the brain of the 737 NGX and it can help you automate many tasks and optimize your flight. You can watch this tutorial by a real Boeing pilot[^1^] to learn some useful FMC tips and tricks.
- Use a realistic flight plan from Simbrief or other sources to plan your fuel, payload, weather, and route. You can import your flight plan into the PMDG 737 NGX using the FMS Data Manager or manually entering the waypoints. You can also use Simbrief to generate a detailed OFP (Operational Flight Plan) that contains all the information you need for your flight. You can watch this video[^3^] to learn how to import Simbrief flight plans into the PMDG 737 NGX.
- Follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklists for every phase of flight. The PMDG 737 NGX comes with a comprehensive documentation that explains the procedures and systems of the aircraft. You can also use the interactive tutorial flights that guide you through a complete flight from cold and dark to shutdown. You can find these documents and tutorials in the PMDG folder in your FSX directory.
- Practice different scenarios and situations using the failures and options menu. The PMDG 737 NGX allows you to simulate various malfunctions and emergencies that can occur during flight. You can also customize the options and settings of the aircraft to suit your preferences and needs. You can access these menus by pressing ALT on your keyboard and selecting PMDG from the menu bar.

Another way to enhance your flying experience with the PMDG 737 NGX is to install different liveries for the aircraft. Liveries are the paint schemes and logos that airlines use to decorate their planes. You can find many liveries for the PMDG 737 NGX on various websites and forums, such as AVSIM[^1^] [^2^], PMDG[^3^], and The AVSIM Community[^4^]. Some liveries are official and supported by PMDG, while others are unofficial and created by independent painters.
 
To install a livery for the PMDG 737 NGX, you will need to download the file that contains the texture and configuration files. The file format is usually .ptp (PMDG Texture Package) or .zip (compressed folder).
