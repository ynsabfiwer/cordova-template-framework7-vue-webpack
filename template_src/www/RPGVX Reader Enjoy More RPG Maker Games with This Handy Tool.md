# How to Use RPGVX Reader to Play RPG Maker Games
 
If you are a fan of RPG Maker games, you may have encountered some games that require RPGVX RTP to run. RPGVX RTP is a runtime package that contains the graphics, music, and .dll files used when creating a game with RPG Maker VX[^2^]. However, installing RPGVX RTP can be troublesome for some users, especially if they have different versions of RPG Maker on their computer.
 
Fortunately, there is a tool that can help you play RPGVX games without installing RPGVX RTP. It is called RPGVX Reader[^1^], and it is a simple program that can read and run RPGVX games from a zip file. You don't need to install anything or extract the game files. Just download RPGVX Reader and open the zip file of the game you want to play.
