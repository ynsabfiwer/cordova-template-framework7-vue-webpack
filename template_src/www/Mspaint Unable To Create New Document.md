# How to Fix the Mspaint Unable to Create New Document Error
 
If you are trying to use Mspaint on Windows 10 and you encounter an error message that says "Unable to create new document", you are not alone. This is a common issue that many users have reported and it can be frustrating when you want to edit or create an image. Fortunately, there are some simple solutions that you can try to fix this problem and get Mspaint working again.
 
The first thing you should do is check if you have enough disk space on your computer. Mspaint needs some free space to create and save images, so if your disk is full or nearly full, you may encounter this error. To check your disk space, go to Settings > System > Storage and see how much space you have left on your C: drive. If it is less than 10% of the total capacity, you should try to free up some space by deleting unnecessary files, uninstalling unused programs, or using Disk Cleanup.

The second thing you should do is update your Windows 10 to the latest version. Sometimes, outdated or corrupted system files can cause Mspaint to malfunction and display this error. To update your Windows 10, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click on Check for updates. If there are any available updates, download and install them and then restart your computer.
 
The third thing you should do is reinstall Mspaint. Sometimes, Mspaint may get damaged or corrupted due to malware, viruses, or other reasons and need to be reinstalled. To reinstall Mspaint, go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features and find Microsoft Paint in the list of apps. Click on it and then click on Uninstall. After it is uninstalled, go to Microsoft Store and search for Microsoft Paint. Download and install it again and then try to use it.
 
These are some of the most common solutions that can help you fix the Mspaint unable to create new document error.

Another possible cause of the Mspaint unable to create new document error is a conflict with another program or service that is running on your computer. Sometimes, other programs or services may interfere with Mspaint and prevent it from creating or saving images. To check if this is the case, you can try to run Mspaint in safe mode. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts Windows with only the essential drivers and services. To start Windows in safe mode, follow these steps:
 
1. Press the Windows logo key + R to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type msconfig and click OK.
3. On the System Configuration window, go to the Boot tab and check the box next to Safe boot.
4. Click OK and then Restart.
5. After your computer restarts in safe mode, try to use Mspaint and see if the error persists.
6. If the error is gone, it means that there is a conflict with another program or service that is running on your computer. You can try to identify and disable the problematic program or service by using the System Configuration window again and unchecking the boxes next to each item under the Services and Startup tabs. You can then restart your computer normally and see if Mspaint works.
7. If the error is still there, it means that there is another issue that is causing it. You can exit safe mode by using the System Configuration window again and unchecking the box next to Safe boot.

One more possible cause of the Mspaint unable to create new document error is a corrupted or missing registry entry. The registry is a database that stores information and settings for Windows and other programs. Sometimes, the registry may get corrupted or deleted due to malware, viruses, or other reasons and cause Mspaint to malfunction. To fix this issue, you can try to use a registry cleaner software that can scan and repair any errors in your registry. However, you should be careful when using such software as they may also delete some important entries that are needed for your system. You should always backup your registry before using any registry cleaner software. To backup your registry, follow these steps:
