Nasha is not a movie that has received much critical acclaim. The movie has a low rating of 3.2 out of 10 on IMDb[^3^], based on 1.3K user reviews. Most of the reviews criticize the movie for its poor script, direction, and acting. Some also complain that the movie is not erotic enough, despite its genre and hype.
 
One of the user reviews on IMDb says: "Nasha, ironically, would be far more appreciated by the ones who aren't allowed to watch it - Teenagers"[^3^]. The reviewer points out the flaws in the movie's plot, characters, and logic. He also says that the movie fails to explore the psychological aspects of the teacher-student relationship, and instead relies on cheap thrills and clichÃ©s.
 
Another review on India Today gives the movie a rating of "Minus Zero" and calls it a "cheap and forgettable film". The reviewer says that the movie has nothing to offer except Poonam Pandey's skin show, which is also boring and repetitive. He also says that the movie is a waste of time and money for the viewers.
 
It seems that Nasha is a movie that does not live up to its name or expectations. It is neither a thrilling nor a sensual experience for the audience. It is a movie that tries to cash in on the controversy and fame of Poonam Pandey, but fails to deliver anything substantial or memorable.
  
Nasha is also a movie that did not perform well at the box office. According to Bollywood Hungama, the movie had a budget of Rs. 5 crores and collected only Rs. 3.68 crores in India. The movie was released on July 26, 2013, and faced competition from other movies like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, D-Day, and Ramaiya Vastavaiya.
 
The movie also failed to attract the overseas audience. The movie collected only Rs. 0.13 crores in the international markets. The movie was not released in many countries due to its adult content and certification. The movie also faced protests and bans from some groups who objected to its poster and theme.
 
Nasha is a movie that proved to be a disaster for both the makers and the viewers. It is a movie that neither satisfied the critics nor the fans. It is a movie that lost money and reputation for everyone involved. It is a movie that should be avoided by anyone who values quality cinema.
